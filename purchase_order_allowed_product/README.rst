Purchase order allowed product
==============================

This module adds a restriction in purchase orders that has the mark "Use only
allowed products" checked for allowing to select only products that can be
supplied by the supplier.

The restriction can be set by default for each partner, and it's propagated
to their purchase orders, but it can be change for each order if you want.
