Sale order types
================

This module adds a typology for the sale orders and to the customers. This
typology can be defined as "proof".
By selecting a customer in the sales order, their typology will be charged on
the sales order.
By confirming the sales order, if their typology is "proof", to create the
picking, it was created as "non-billable".
