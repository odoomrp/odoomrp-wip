Procurement plan - Manufacturing
================================

This module inherit the module 'procurement_plan'. When procurements run from
the plan, all Procurements, purchases, and generated MRP Productions, are
associated with the plan.

You can import procurements with "Internal" location, and then click the
button "Generate procurements", what it does is generate procurements for all
products that are needed in the production of this final product.

Also, by confirming a sales order, if a procurement order of a product to
produce is generated, procurement plan is automatically created for that
procurement order, and also automatically creates lower levels of the same.

Configuration
=============
In the form of the company, in the "Configurations" tab, you can define the
level of procurement order to run, when a procurement plan is created
confirming a sale.
