Block Serial Numbers/lots
=========================
This module allows you to define whether a Serial Number/lot is blocked
or not.
The default value can be set on the Product Category, in the
field "Block new Serial Numbers/lots".

Two new buttons let you block/unblock a Serial Number/lot in the form view.
Blocking/unblocking can also be done from the list view, by selecting the
Serial Numbers/lots and choosing the option "Block/Unblock lots".

Only lots which have no reservation can be blocked.

Manufacturing Orders and Delivery Orders are not allowed to select a
blocked down Serial Number/lot.
